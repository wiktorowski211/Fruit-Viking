# 🍉Fruit-Viking
🍒This is an experimental application combining a simple game with efficient image recognition in order to use a physical object as a marker controlling the in game cursor.  
🍇The prototype is being written in Python (tested on Python3.6 and 3.7), uses opencv and pygame libraries. The goal of the project is to integrate both while keeping stable fps (frames per second) and responsivity.  
🍌Python was chosen as the technology due to the extensive support when it comes to opencv library.
